Face Emotion Recognition Project 
 
I created a Facial Expression Classifier with a public dataset FER2013 of human facial expressions, 
which consists of images of European faces and corresponding emotions (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) and a set of non-labeld Korean face images.

I trained a Facial Expression Classifier on the European Faces Dataset (FER2013) and tested it on the Test set of FER2013. 
Later,I tested the performance of the classifier on the provided Test set of Korean Faces Dataset. 
 
Dataset 
The Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) Dataset.
FER2013 is in .csv file (fer2013.csv), where each row is one example: first column is label/emotion, second - representation of image pixels, 
and the third is usage (whether the image is Training or Testing)

Korean Faces dataset. â€‹
The folder consists of images and a .csv file, which has image file names and empty corresponding labels.
 
FER2013 is images with (48x48x1) dimension, 
however, Korean Dataset consists of images of different sizes (MxNx3).
Apply data manipulation techniques to scale Korean dataset to have the same dimension as European dataset.
